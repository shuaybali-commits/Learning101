## OverTheWire: Bandit (Levels 0–20)

I completed the OverTheWire Bandit wargame to build strong Linux and security fundamentals.

### What I practiced
- Linux navigation, permissions, and file handling
- Searching and filtering data with `find`, `grep`, `sort`, `uniq`, `strings`
- Handling unusual filenames (spaces, dashes, hidden files)
- Encoding and decoding data (Base64, ROT13)
- Working with compressed and archived files (gzip, bzip2, tar)
- SSH fundamentals (keys, permissions, authentication)
- Networking basics using `nc` and TLS connections with `openssl`
